# Ok so this is a big tricky to get right.
# We want this to be in increments of a day, so that the SB375 target
# calculation makes sense.
# The high level plan is to run it around midnight everyday and update the
# score based on the day that just passed. But what exactly does "around
# midnight" mean?
# It can't be just before midnight, because then we will skip trips around midnight
# I guess we start right after midnight
# Couple of other challenges:
# - What to do about trips that span days?
# - What to do about people in other time zones who have a different midnight?
# In order to handle both of these, we should really have task scheduled from
# the app instead of a cronjob, and have it track the last time it was run. But
# let's do the cheap solution for now so that we know whether it works at all.
