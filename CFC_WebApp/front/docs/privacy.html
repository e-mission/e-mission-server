<h2>E-Mission: Data driven carbon emission reduction</h2>
This app is designed to collect information for a research study at the
University of California, Berkeley. The study is being led by <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~shankari">K. Shankari</a> under the
supervision of <a href="http://tsrc.berkeley.edu/SusanShaheen">Prof. Susan
Shaheen</a>.
<p>
The goal of the study is to understand people’s travel behavior and mode usage
as people commute to trip generators. We will use this information to provide
you with a personalized carbon footprint for travel that can be compared with
the average carbon footprint of our users. In addition, we will use the
aggregate data to recommend structural changes and incentives that can be used
to change the mode share to one that is less carbon intensive.
<p>
We understand that location data can be sensitive, and we have taken several
precautions related to the security of your data. In particular:
<ol>
  <li>All communication with our server is encrypted.</li>
  <li>We divide our endpoints into ones that expose personally identifiable
  information (PII) (such as your personal carbon footprint) and ones which
  expose aggregate information (such as the carbon footprint of UC Berkeley). All
  endpoints which expose PII have a “user” field in the request that is used for
  authentication.</li>
  <li>We use your gmail ID for authentication in order to avoid the risks
  associated with storing passwords. If you wish to remain completely anonymous,
  you can create a separate gmail address only for this app.</li>
  <li>The trip data is associated with unique user IDs, not with the gmail addresses. The mapping from the userIDs to the gmail addresses is done through a separate table. The lead researcher (Shankari) is the only person who has access to the database, for both the trip and user access tables. Other researchers will only have access to data from the trip database, exported by the lead researcher, but without the identifying gmail addresses.</li>
  <li>The server on which the web app is running is protected by a firewall which only exposes the Secure Shell (SSH) and HTTPS ports - the database cannot be accessed directly from outside the host. The SSH server on the host is configured to only support public key authentication, and the only user with access to the private key for the server is the lead researcher (Shankari).</li>
</ol>
Note, however, that we integrate with a third party app - <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/">Moves</a> - to collect the data. Moves has its <a href="http://www.moves-app.com/privacy.html">own policies on data collection, privacy and storage</a>. We communicate with Moves over SSL, using an access token for authentication.

Please note that Moves was recently acquired by Facebook, so data collected by
Moves is searchable by Facebook. You do not have to provide your Facebook ID to
use either Moves or E-Mission, so there is no explicit link between the data
collected and your Facebook identity.  We communicate with Moves over SSL,
using an access token for authentication.

<h3>If you have questions</h3>
The main researcher conducting this study is K. Shankari, a graduate student in
department of EECS at University of California, Berkeley. If you have
questions, you may contact K. Shankari at <a
href="mailto:shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu">shankari@eecs.berkeley.edu</a>. If you
have any questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this
study, you may contact the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human
Participants at 510-642-7461 or access their website at

<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
Shankari is honored to have been supported by the Jim Gray Fellowship for the
duration of this project. <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gray_%28computer_scientist%29">Jim
Gray</a>, who did pioneering work on the management of large amounts of data,
disappeared while sailing in San Francisco Bay in 2007.  We like to think that
this work, which aims to use large amounts of data to understand and influence
travel patterns, is something that he would have found interesting.
