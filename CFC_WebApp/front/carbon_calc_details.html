<h2>Details of how we compute the carbon footprint</h2>
Computing the carbon footprint of transportation is tricky to do in sufficient
detail. At a high level, the computation involves two components.
<ol>
<li> The distance travelled</li>
<li> The energy consumed per unit distance</li>
</ol>
As part of this project, we are greatly improving the accuracy of the first
piece. However, for the second piece, we just use the averages for each
transportation mode from published data. This means that both individual
changes such as switching to more fuel efficient cars, and larger changes such
as the electrification of Caltrain, will not affect the calculation.
<p>
In the future, we will allow users to specify their vehicle, and also use the
fleet-wide carbon emission metrics for transit agencies, which should make this
calculation a lot more accurate. This should not be too challenging technically.
<p>
For maximum accuracy, we will have to take into account the driving patterns of
individual drivers. We will have to experiment with the data that we collect as
part of this study, and see if it is possible to infer these patterns from the
data that we collect.
<p>
In addition, we provide three comparison metrics to frame this number in a larger context.
<ol>
<li> SB 375 mandates per capita CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> transportation emission
reduction targets for 2020 and 2035. We show the 2035 target.
<li> EO S-3-05 mandates that carbon emissions be reduced to 80% of 1990 levels
by 2050. This does not mandate the share of the reduction from the
transportation sector. We show a target assuming a proportional reduction, so
that transportation emissions are also 80% below 1990 levels by 2050.
<li> Finally, we show the potential carbon footprint achievable if a user
changed their commute pattern so that all short trips (&lt; 3 miles) were through
non-motorized transport and all long trips (&gt; 3 miles) were through the most
efficient motorized transport (train for &lt; 600 miles, air for &gt; 600
miles). This provides users a concrete and achieveable goal that they can work
towards.
</ol>
<h3>GHG emission table</h3>
Data on motorized transport is from <a
href="http://www.its.berkeley.edu/publications/UCB/2008/VWP/UCB-ITS-VWP-2008-2.pdf">"Environmental
Life-cycle Assessment of Passenger Transportation : A Detailed Methodology for
Energy, Greenhouse Gas, and Criteria Pollutant Inventories of Automobiles,
Buses, Light Rail, Heavy Rail and Air", Mikhail Chester and Arpad Horvath, UC
Berkeley Center for Future Urban Transport, UCB-ITS-VWP-2008-2</a>.
<p>
We use the Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG, measured in g
CO<sub><small>2</small></sub>e) per Passenger Mile Travelled (PMT) and convert
it to Passenger Kilometers Travelled (PKmT) as our contribution towards moving
the US to a metric system.

<h3>Comparison data</h3>
<h4>SB 375 data</h4>
The <a href="http://arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/mpo.co2.reduction.calc.pdf">California
Air Resources Board (CARB) has estimated transportation related GHG emissions
for the implementation of SB 375</a>. The corresponding numbers for the Bay
Area are reproduced here for convenience. Note that their values are computed
in lbs/weekday, so we convert them to kg/week by using a factor of 0.453592 * 5
= 2.267960.
<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>lbs/weekday</th><th>kg/week</th></tr>
<tr><td>Baseline (2005)</td><td>20.8</td><td>47.173568</td></tr>
<tr><td>SB 375 target for 2020</td><td>19.3</td><td>43.771628</td></tr>
<tr><td>SB 375 target for 2035</td><td>17.7</td><td>40.142892</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>EO S-3-05 goal</h4>
The <a
href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/staff_report_1990_level.pdf">CARB
estimated the 1990 baseline for all emissions as 427 Million </a> Metrics Tons
of CO<sub><small>2</small></sub> emitted (MMTCO2e). The transportation
component of that was 38%, or 182.4 MMTCO2e. The passenger vehicle (cars and
light-duty truck) component is 70% of that, at 108.5 MMTCO2e.
<p>
We can use that to estimate total transportation emissions in 2020 and 2050
assuming that all sectors had to cut their emissions proportionally. Note that
the proportional cuts, while reasonable, are NOT mandated in the executive
order.
<p>
The 1990 population estimate is from the
<a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-2.pdf">US census bureau</a>.
The 2020 and 2050 projections are from the
<a href="http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/projections/p-1/documents/Projections_Press_Release_2010-2060.pdf">California Department of Finance</a>.
<p>
The per capita calculation is per the formula
<code><pre>
per capita kg CO2e/wk = (1,000,000 * 1000 * MMTCO2e) / (population * 52)
</pre></code>
<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Yearly MMTCO2e (cars/trucks)</th><th>Population</th><th>Per Capita kgCO2e/wk</th></tr>
<tr><td>Baseline (1990)</td><td> 108.5 </td><td> 29,760,021 </td><td>70.11213</td></tr>
<tr><td>2020</td><td> 108.5 </td><td>40,643,643</td><td> 51.33738 </td></tr>
<tr><td>2050</td><td> 21.70 </td><td>50,365,074</td><td> 8.28565 </td></tr>

<h4>Optimal E-Mission</h4>
In order to calculate the optimal E-Mission for a particular user, we
classified all motorized trips into short (&lt; 3 miles/5km) and long (&gt; 3
miles/5km).
<ol>
<li> We did this for both transit and private auto trips because the average
carbon footprint of a bus, when both peak and off-peak hours are included
(267), does not appear to be much lower than that an average private auto (278).
<li> We chose 3 miles (5 km) as the boundary between short and long trips,
because we believe that it is a reasonable distance to bicycle. In addition,
two 3 mile trips at a 12 mph pace will provide the user with their recommended
30 mins of exercise a day.
<li> The boundary is different for air travel because people don't use planes
for 5km trips. Instead, we assume that short trips that are roughly the distance
between San Francisco and Los Angeles (~ 600km). <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela_Express">Wikipedia claims</a> that the
Acela has captured 75% of air/train riders between Washington D.C. and New York
City (~ 400km) and 54% of riders between Washington D.C. and Boston (~ 700km),
so this seems like a reasonable choice.
