# When I initially started tracking scores, I was lazy and stored the
# carbonFootprint in the same field as the gamification score, instead of
# having client specific fields. This made sense if you thought that there was
# one "result" field that was populated in different ways by different clients.
# Unfortunately, this model broke for the "choice" client, because we wanted to
# store multiple results at the same time.
# So now, I have moved the field access code into the specific clients.
# But I need to go through and fix the existing users
# For all users who are not in the "gamified" group, we need to move their
# carbon footprint from the currentScore field to the carbon_footprint field,
# and delete the currentScore and previousScore fields
