		<div class = "smaller_text"> <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Users will receive suggestions on their latest trips as well as the option to see suggestions for all their trips. </div>
		<div class = "smaller_text"> <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> The suggestions are generated based on restaurant location. For example if the user is driving to a coffee shop 5 miles away but we see there is one of equal rating .5 miles away, the user will be suggested to go to that one instead.  </div>
		<div class = "smaller_text"> <i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Users will also be given surveys regarding their transportation patterns and opinions on the suggestions  </div>
