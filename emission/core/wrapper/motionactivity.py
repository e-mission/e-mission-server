    # iOS only. Sometimes, the activity has all modes = false.
    # I don't know how/why that should happen, but if it does,
    # What we probably want to do is to ignore such entries,
    # but we can't really do so while copying because every input
    # in the user cache has an entry in long-term. So we create
    # a "none" type to support it, and will ignore it when we 
    # do the segmentation
    NONE = 9
    # iOS only. iOS supports multiple activities being true simultaneously.
    # From the CMMotionActivity documentation,
    # "The motion-related properties of this class are not mutually exclusive.
    # In other words, it is possible for more than one of the motion-related
    # properties to contain the value YES. For example, if the user was driving
    # in a car and the car stopped at a red light, the update event associated 
    # with that change in motion would have both the automotive and stationary
    # properties set to YES."
    # In our examples also, this is the only case that I have seen with 
    # multiple values = true. In general, we should probably handle this with a 
    # bit string, but that will also make the segmentation logic
    # more complex. Let us just create a type for this combination and move on
    # for now. If we see other combinations in the future, we can figure out 
    # how to deal with it at that time.
