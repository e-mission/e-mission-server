Questions:

Are we training the model on all trips or just the ones from this user?
Are we retraining the whole model every time?
How to know if the section has never been predicted?
	is it quicker to check for a match in the prediction db or
	to automatically store all sections in the prediction db with a 0 for prediction type
	and then just see how many we have in there and then match them up with the section?
