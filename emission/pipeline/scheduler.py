    """
    This is the count of messages in the usercache. While we can use it for the
    scheduling, it is just a hint, because having a zero count here is no guarantee
    of zero count in the processing. And in particular, having a zero count here is
    no indication that there are no pending entries in the long-term cache. I think
    that's why we used to have the long-term cache and the user cache uuid list separately.

    That technique is no longer feasible because it requires coordination after the
    usercache is processed instead of parallelizing the entire pipeline.

    In general, this should be a pretty good hint, but I am not sure that it is perfect,
    and I am not ready to try this out weeks before the big deployment, with one day's
    testing. I also don't want to use UserCache.getMessage() since it returns the entire
    list instead of just the count. So we use the count as a hint and don't filter out
    users based on that.
