# We intentionally don't use a dataframe for the segment list, using a
# segment class instead. The reasons are as follows:
# 1. We don't really need any of the fancy row, column or matrix
# operations. We are going to iterate over the list one step at a time.
# 2. We have potentially have to resplit segments, which involves inserting
# elements at arbitrary points in the list. With a dataframe, we would need
# to reindex every time we did this, which we won't have to do if we use a
# simple list. It should be trivial to re-implement this as a DataFrame if
# we so choose.
# This is only used by SmoothZigzag currently. I had originally made this an
# inner class, but inner classes in python are not special so let's move it out
# and make the indenting less complicated
