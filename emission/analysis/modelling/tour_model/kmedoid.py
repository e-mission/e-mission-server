"""
This file implements the k-medoid clustering algorithm. 

As input, this takes:
- data: the data set to cluster, as a list of four-dimensional points. 
- k: the number of clusters

This code runs slowly. I am working on making it faster. 

code based on K_medoid_2.py in CFC_WebApp/main
The changes that I made were a few small changes to make 
the code run faster and provide a way to calculate and store 
the distance matrix.
