        Store trips for the last week to the cache. Any entries older than 3 days
        should be purged. Note that this currently repeats information - the data that
        was from day before yesterday, for example, would have been sent at that point
        as well.  As an optimization, we could use something like CouchDB to only send
        the diffs back and forth. Or use a simple syncing mechanism in which the
        write_ts of the "document" reflects time that the documents were generated, and
        only sync new documents? In general, the write_ts of the generated document
        should be within a few hours of the intake document.

        Second question: How do we send back the travel diary data? As the
        raw entries from the database, or in geojson format?

        After much thought, we are planning to send materialized views over
        the data in various json formats. In particular, we plan to send
        the trip information in geojson format, and the result
        visualizations in either vega or mpld3 formats.

        Since we plan to store all the data in a giant event database,
        materializing the views is likely to be a complex process. Doing
        the materialization ahead of time helps with responsiveness. Note
        that in principle, we could store the timeseries and materialize
        views directly on the phone as well, but in general we choose to do that on the
        server for flexibility and ease of programming.

        This also means that the write_ts of the view naturally corresponds
        to the time that it was generated, as opposed to sensed, which
        provides us with all kinds of goodness.

        :return: Nothing. As a side effect, we materialize views from the
        data and store them into the usercache to be sent to the phone
