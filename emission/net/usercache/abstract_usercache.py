# The server side implementation of the user cache

# This is an abstract superclass that can be implemented with couchbase, azure,
# or our builtin solution.

# Note also that this is the interface between the user cache and the rest of the code
# The REST interface between the rest of the code and this cache is in
# CFC_WebApp, consistent with the rest of our philosophy 

# If a different sync mechanism such as couchbase or azure is being used, then
# the communication between the phone and the server will happen through their
# API, not our REST API. Separating the REST part from the integration with the
# rest of the code (ha!) allows us to separate those concerns as well

# Let's switch to new-style classes finally!!
