# Simple decorator that pulls data from a combination of the usercache and the timeseries.
# We could avoid this if we put data directly into the timeseries when it came in instead of
# buffering
# but that puts more processing into the push thread, which might be a problem for the 30s
# time window on iOS. At any rate, we would need to test that before we make that change.
# We may also be able to remove this if we run the pipeline more frequently, but would
# need to test that
