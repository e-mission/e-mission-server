    "~~Notice that the overall accuracy for the mode car prediction is 80%, even though we listed it as two separate predictions of 50% and 30%. Thus, in the way that I'm currently assessing confidence, these would be treated as two separate predictions, and be placed in the 0.3-0.4 and 0.5-0.6 deciles, even though it should be a single prediction in the 0.8-0.9 decile. ~~\n",
    "\n",
    "~~This also explains why we're 'overconfident' for lower deciles but it becomes more realistic for higher deciles: at higher deciles, it is less likely that I counted a prediction in the wrong decile (there are simply fewer deciles above it that it could belong in). ~~\n",

    "\n",
    "Option 2 is going to take more work with refactoring the code base, but it also seems like the better long-term option, since we plan to merge label assist with sensed-mode in the ensemble algorithm (which means some trips may have predicted mode but no predicted purpose), and we can try to extend the label assist algorithm to predict a trip's purpose even when the start location is not known (which would not yield a predicted mode or replaced mode).
