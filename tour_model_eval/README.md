This directory contains the ipython notebooks used to tune and evaluate the
first round cluster algorithm. It uses an O(n^2) algorithm to iterate over a
set of n trips, and cluster them into bins based on proximity of start and end
points.

To understand the evolution of this process, including a comparison of this
algorithm with DBSCAN, please see 
https://github.com/e-mission/e-mission-eval-private-data/pull/28

which includes explanations and intermediate results
