This folder contains code used in the TRB paper submission on label-assist 
algorithms. In addition, the notebooks contain code that can be used to 
generate the figures displayed in the paper. 

These notebooks rely on modifications in a [branch](https://github.com/hlu109/e-mission-server/tree/eval-private-data-compatibility) of the e-mission-server. Ensure that this version of the server is set up according to the [instructions in this repository's main README](../README.md).
