"""
High level overivew of alternative_trips_pipeline
The main method for this pipeline is calc_perturbed_trips
We first construct a trip iterator, and look at each trip where the pipelineFlags attribte "alternativesStarted" is False
For each of these trips, we create an array of trip objects, which are modifications to the original trip object with perturbed times
We also have a database collection that associates each original trip, with all of its perturbed trips
For each array of perturbed trip objects, we schedule those queries via CRON jobs
We initialize each perturbed trip as None, and we update the collection as the queries are being made
Overview of helper files relevant to this pipeline:
    -query.py -> makes a google maps query immediately to get the directions
              -> will also store the query into the database collection
    -perturb.py -> schedules calls to query.py on cron jobs
    @TODO: this doesn't exist yet, but it would make more sense than to put it in here in order to keep the code clean
    -database_util.py -> contains all the helper methods to abstract out interaction with the database
