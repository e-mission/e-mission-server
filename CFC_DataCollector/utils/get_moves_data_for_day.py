# It is hard, if not impossible to test this properly.
# First, we would need to write an integration test, not a unit test
# Second, the test would need to hardcode a token, which expires every 6 months,
# so the test would need to be refreshed every 6 months
# Third, the full storyline with trackpoints is only available for 7 days, so the test
# would need to call the service with a dynamic date, which means that we cannot check in
# the expected result.
# 
# The traditional solution would be to provide a mock class to test against.
# However, given that this is not part of the normal operation of the system,
# and is a debug tool anyway, I am just going to skip the unit test
